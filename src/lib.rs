/// [`String`] is a `Vec<u8>` which is a `(RawVec, usize)` which is a `((Unique, usize), usize)`.

/// Rust explicitly says that structs are not guaranteed to have members in order,
/// so instead we determine that order at runtime.

///
/// This function is 100% memory-safe.

/// Nevetheless, remember to use [`std::mem::forget`] to deallocate the fake [`String`], otherwise Rust
/// will think the pointer has been allocated by the global allocator and free it the wrong way.
