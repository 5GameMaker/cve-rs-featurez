Rust is an amazing language. You can program a lot of useful things while ensuring that your program will stay safe and not corrupt its own memory. Now, with **cve-rs**, you can corrupt your program's memory without corrupting your program's memory.

We are very committed to making sure our code is memory-safe. That is why we use `#![deny(unsafe_code)]` in the entire codebase. There is not a single block of `unsafe` code in this project.

## Install

**cve-rs** can be installed using Cargo:

```sh
cargo install cve-rs
```

## WASM support

**cve-rs** supports WASM through the WASI API.

You can compile it and run it using [Wasmer](https://wasmer.io/) with the following commands:

```sh
cargo build --target wasm32-wasi
wasmer run target/wasm32-wasi/debug/cve-rs.wasm
```
