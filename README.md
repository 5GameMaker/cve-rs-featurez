Rust is an amazing language. You can program a lot of useful things while ensuring that your program will stay safe and not corrupt its own memory. Now, with **cve-rs**, you can corrupt your program's memory without corrupting your program's memory.

We are very committed to making sure our code is memory-safe. That is why we use `#![deny(unsafe_code)]` in the entire codebase. There is not a single block of `unsafe` code in this project.
